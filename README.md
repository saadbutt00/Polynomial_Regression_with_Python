# Polynomial_Regression_with_Python

I first created python script that only takes values for features & give prediction but without storing data.

### ðŸ§  Linear Regression Web App (Streamlit)

In Streamlit app, I ended this problem & let users **train a custom polynomial regression model** with one or more features.
Users can enter feature names and values, train the model with a specified bias, and make real-time predictions.
The app displays learned coefficients, calculates model accuracy (RÂ² score), and supports named inputs for clarity.
No pre-uploaded dataset requiredâ€”users manually input data for full control and learning.
Ideal for students and beginners to understand how polynomial regression works step-by-step. But, Can also be used to make some 
predictions.
